    "## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in SQL - Part 3\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we leverage the power of SQL to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The primary objective is to unearth valuable insights from the dataset, paving the way for informed decision-making and strategic planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this EDA in SQL is to:\n",
    "- Explore the dataset comprehensively to understand its characteristics, distributions, and relationships.\n",
    "- Identify key patterns, trends, and anomalies within the data.\n",
    "- Generate actionable insights to drive business decisions and strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Versatility of SQL:** Showcase the flexibility and effectiveness of SQL for exploratory analysis.\n",
    "- **Insight Generation:** Utilize SQL queries to extract meaningful insights and derive actionable conclusions.\n",
    "- **Data Preparation for Visualization:** Save the results of SQL queries as CSV files for ingestion into visualization tools such as Power BI, Tableau, MS Excel, and Google Sheets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Query Execution:** Execute SQL queries to explore various aspects of the dataset, including summary statistics, distributions, and relationships between variables.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Insight Generation:** Analyze the results of SQL queries to identify patterns, trends, and correlations within the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Export to CSV:** Save the results of SQL queries as CSV files to facilitate ingestion into visualization tools for further analysis and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging SQL for exploratory data analysis, we aim to extract actionable insights and unlock the full potential of the dataset to drive business success."

    "#### High-Value Clients:\n",
    "- **Definition:** High-value clients represent individuals whose financial engagements exceed standard thresholds, showcasing significant activity within the banking realm.\n",
    "- **Characteristics:** A high-value account is distinguished by holding an amount exceeding a threshold in account balances, loan amounts, transaction volume, loan payments, etc. It is indicative of substantial financial involvement.\n",
    "- **Varied Criteria:** High-value client classification encompasses diverse criteria tailored to specific financial contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose:\n",
    "This analysis aims to pinpoint and assess high-value clients based on their financial interactions across diverse banking services. By delving into the transactions associated with bank orders, loans, and general financial activities, this query sheds light on customers with notable transactional patterns. Such insights hold significance for targeted marketing initiatives, tailored financial offerings, and effective risk management strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Top *N* High-Valued Accounts Criteria: \n",
    "\n",
    "To qualify as a high-valued account, the following criteria are assessed:\n",
    "- **Loan Amount:** Accounts with loan amounts surpassing a threshold.\n",
    "- **Loan Payment Volume:** Accounts with loan payments surpassing a threshold.\n",
    "- **Bank Account Balance:** Accounts with higher than average balance.\n",
    "- **Deposit Volume:** Accounts with bank deposit volume amounts surpassing a threshold.\n",
