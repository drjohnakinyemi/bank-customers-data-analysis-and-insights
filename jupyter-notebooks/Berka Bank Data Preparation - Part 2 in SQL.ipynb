    "## **Berka Bank Data Preparation - Part 2 [in SQL]**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Introduction**\n",
    "This notebook serves as a demonstration of the versatility of SQL in executing essential data preprocessing and cleaning tasks utilizing MS SQL Server for exploratory data analysis (EDA). \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Purpose**\n",
    "The primary objectives of this SQL-centric data preparation phase are as follows:\n",
    "1. Gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's structure and content.\n",
    "2. Perform descriptive statistics analysis to unveil key insights.\n",
    "3. Address data quality issues including missing values, data type inconsistencies, and text standardization.\n",
    "4. Tackle challenges such as duplicate and inconsistent data entries.\n",
    "5. Validate the integrity and accuracy of the dataset.\n",
    "6. Introduce new tables and columns derived from existing data to enhance analytical capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Tasks**\n",
    "1. **Understanding Dataset Structure:** Explore the dataset's schema and identify potential issues.\n",
    "2. **Descriptive Statistics Analysis:** Utilize SQL queries to extract summary statistics and uncover noteworthy patterns.\n",
    "3. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**\n",
    "    - Handle missing values.\n",
    "    - Correct data type mismatches, including date data types.\n",
    "    - Standardize text data for consistency.\n",
    "    - Address duplicate and inconsistent data entries.\n",
    "4. **Data Validation:** Execute validation checks to ensure data integrity.\n",
    "5. **Augmentation:** Introduce new tables and columns based on existing data for enriched analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "As we embark on this SQL-driven data preparation journey, we aim to lay a solid foundation for subsequent exploratory analysis. By harnessing the power of SQL within MS SQL Server, we endeavor to transform the raw Berka Bank dataset into a clean, structured entity for insightful analysis."

    "## Data Import & Establishing Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading:** Import all eight CSV datasets into the MS SQL Server.\n",
    "2. **Key Constraints:** Define primary and foreign key constraints for appropriate tables to ensure data integrity.\n",
    "3. **Relationship Establishment:** Establish relationships between tables to reflect the logical connections between entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Comprehensive Understanding:** Undertake a thorough analysis of the dataset to gain insights into its data, structure, content, and potential issues.\n",
    "* **Data Sampling:** Examine representative samples from each table to grasp the dataset's characteristics and verify its integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Action Items: \n",
    "To address potential conflicts and enhance clarity:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Table Renaming:**\n",
    "  - Rename the \"Order\" table to \"BankOrder\" to avoid conflicts with SQL keywords.\n",
    "  - Rename the \"Transaction\" table to \"BankTransaction\" to mitigate naming clashes and ensure clarity in communication."
